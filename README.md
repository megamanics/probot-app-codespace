## Installation

Make sure you've got [Node.js installed](https://Node.js.org/en/download/) on your workstation, than open your terminal and type the following command:

- if you're using `npm` (the package manager bundled with `Node.js`):

  ```sh
  npx create-probot-app my-first-app
  ```

- if you're using Yarn:

  ```sh
  yarn create probot-app my-first-app
  ```

and follow the instructions printed on the terminal as you go. `create-probot-app` will then take care of the heavy lifting required to setup a Probot app development environment, with proper folder structure, and even installing all the basic `Probot` dependencies.

## How to run locally

See the [Probot docs](https://probot.github.io/docs/development/#running-the-app-locally) to get started running your app locally.
